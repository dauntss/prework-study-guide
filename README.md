# Kat's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

With the intent of developing skills in HTML, CSS, Git, and, in particular, Javascript, this Study Guide webpage has been created. This page gives the user an aesthetically pleasing place to read notes on Bootcamp information, and a safe place to test new variables and tags. It allows the user to practice, fiddle, and experiment in a learning environment without hazard.

I have background in CSS and HTML already, but had never learned JS before - so it was very fun to experiment with that and I learned to write and troubleshoot JS functions.
